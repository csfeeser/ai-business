# AI Warm-Up Challenge!

Welcome to today’s warm-up! You’ll complete three short challenges using your AI assistant, **VIRGIL**, or any other generative AI tool you have access to.

Each task focuses on real-world uses of prompt writing, tone control, and output evaluation.

## 💼 Task 1: Tactful Translation  
**Scenario:** You wrote an unprofessional email but thankfully haven't sent it yet. Your job is to rewrite it in a more professional tone **without changing the core message**.

### Original Email:
> "Hey. You were supposed to finish that report yesterday. I’ve been waiting around for you to get your act together. Are you planning to actually do your job, or should I just take over?"

### Your Task:
Use VIRGIL to rewrite this email to be:
- Professional
- Direct
- Still expresses frustration and urgency  
**BUT** without being rude or condescending.

## 🕵️ Task 2: Spot the Hallucination  
**Scenario:** You’ve received a list of AI-generated statements about AI concepts. One of them is completely false, though it sounds convincing.

### List of Statements:
1. A “token” can be smaller than a full word.
2. A prompt library helps reduce hallucinations.
3. Chain prompting means giving multiple prompts in a sequence.
4. A context window limits how much the model can “remember” at once.
5. Generative AI can make up facts confidently.
6. A model is the user interface you type into.
7. Prompts can define the AI’s “role” or perspective.
8. AI hallucination means it’s dreaming like a human.
9. Short, clear prompts often work better than long, vague ones.
10. Rules-based systems rely on logic trees and conditions.

### Your Task:
Use VIRGIL to check each statement. Which one is the **hallucination**?  
Explain why it’s incorrect.

## 🧰 Task 3: Prompt Repair Technician  
**Scenario:** You’ve inherited a messy prompt. It’s too vague, contradictory, and doesn’t give the AI clear direction.

### Broken Prompt:
> “Write something helpful and creative but also super short and extremely detailed about every business tool we use and make it funny and serious. Don’t use technical terms, but explain all the AI stuff clearly.”

### Your Task:
Revise this prompt so that:
- It has one clear goal
- Includes a defined role for the AI
- Sets realistic and clear constraints

Then run your improved version through VIRGIL and see if the result improves.
